"""
Variables can be ANYTHING, because it's just a name, as long as they follow these rules.

 1. Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_)
 2. The rest of the variable name can contain letters, numbers, or underscores
 3. Variable names are case-sensitive (myVar â‰  myvar)
 4. Variable names cannot be Python keywords (like `class`, `if`, `while`, etc.)
5. Variable names cannot start with a number

 Examples of **invalid** variable names:
3dogs = "bad"          # Starts with a number
my-variable = 5        # Hyphen is not allowed
def = "nope"           # 'def' is a reserved keyword
$$$Variable = "bad"    # Special symbols are not allowed
